## How to push your files from LOCAL to REMOTE ?
```bash
git init   //initializes an empty git repository
git branch -m main  //creates "main" as the main branch
git add .  //this adds all the files present in our project folder
git commit -m "commit_name"  //commits these files
git remote add origin url_of_remote_repo  //creates a connection between the local and the remote repo for pushing the files
git push origin main  //pushes the code/files to the remote repo/ github repo we call.
//(tip: **git push -u origin main**)
//Here '-u' helps you later to push the files easily without mentioning the main everytime.
